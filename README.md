## TestData notes

### Mercenaries
    The testData.json versions are based off modified versions of the 
    base stat spreads for the Pokemon listed below.  The initial 
    numbers were arrived at by taking Pokemon with a Base Stat Total
    of between 520 and 540 and rearranging/adjusting them to fit
    the character concept.
        - Bulwark = Blastoise
        - Thief = Crobat
        - Marksman = Feraligatr
        - Cleric = Venusaur
        - Evoker = Porygon-Z
